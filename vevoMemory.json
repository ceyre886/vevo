However, the learningPlan.json file was not found, which means the last learning cycle did not produce a new plan, possibly due to an API response parsing issue.  What works:  Jarvis queries OpenRouter for knowledge gaps and attempts to update its memory. Memory (vevoMemory.json) shows learning attempts and fallback responses. What needs improvement:  Ensure the OpenRouter response is parsed correctly and saved as learningPlan.json. Confirm Jarvis is actually asking external APIs for unknown topics and updating its memory with real answers. Would you like me to fix the learning logic so Jarvis reliably fills its memory with new knowledge from external APIs and saves the learning plan?  GPT-4.1 • 0x",
