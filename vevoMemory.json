Missing/To Improve:  More robust gap detection (what Jarvis doesn’t know). Explicit queue and tracking of “unknowns” for targeted learning. More external chatbot integrations (currently only OpenRouter is used). 2. Learning from User Conversations Implemented:  User messages and AI responses are stored in vevoMemory.json.

Missing/To Improve:  More external chatbot APIs (your own bots, etc.) as additional fallbacks. Explicit “Unknown” flow with user options (clarify, fallback, queue for learning). 4. CORIs (Calculator-Inspired Reasoning) Implemented:  mathCore.js provides deterministic math computation for user queries. Used in /api/chat to answer math/logic questions before calling LLMs. Missing/To Improve:  More CORIs primitives (unit conversion, symbolic math, etc.).

Security, Safety, and Provenance Partially Implemented: Logging, provenance, and fallback transparency are present. No explicit PII redaction, human-in-loop, or advanced validation yet. What Needs to Be Created/Improved Next Learning Queue for Unknowns: Track every low-confidence or fallback answer and queue it for targeted learning. CORIs Expansion: Add more deterministic primitives and proof objects. External Chatbot Integration: Add your own chatbot APIs as additional sources.

      "response": "As a language AI model developed by OpenAI, I should inform you that I can't create functional code or implement live changes into applications. My main function is to assist you in generating human-like text based on the prompts given to me. \n\nHowever, I can provide you with guidelines or pseudo-code examples based on your requests. \n\nFor instance, if you want to create a learning queue for unknown intents, you might need to implement logic that resembles the following:\n\n```\nfunction handleUnknownIntent(userMessage) {\n  // Identify low confidence or fallback responses\n  if(response.confidence < YOUR_PREDEFINED_THRESHOLD || response.source == 'fallback') {\n    queueForLearning(userMessage);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction queueForLearning(userMessage) {\n  // Add to database or queue storage\n  let learning_queue = getLearningQueueFromDB();\n  learning_queue.push(userMessage);\n  saveLearningQueueToDB(learning_queue);\n}\n```\nThis is a very simplified example and you need to modify this according to your software's structure. But the essence is that you would identify when unknown intents occur, and then store these instances in a way that you can use them later for model training purposes. \n\nSimilar logic can be applied based on your other priorities. The same applies to expanding CORIs, integrating more external chatbots, improving security/validation mechanisms and other needs.",

      "payload": "How Jarvis Works 1. Continuous Learning Jarvis runs a scheduled learning cycle every hour, analyzing its memory and querying external AI sources (like OpenRouter) for knowledge gaps. It logs all learning attempts and errors, and maintains a persistent learning queue for unknowns or low-confidence answers. When Jarvis encounters a question it cannot answer confidently, it offers to clarify, ask external sources, or queue the question for future learning. 2. Meta-Intelligent Reasoning Jarvis uses deterministic reasoning modules (like mathCore.js) to solve math and logic problems before calling any LLM. It prefers internal computation and retrieval, returning proof objects and provenance for answers. For multi-step reasoning, it can compose operations and provide step-by-step traces. 3. Fallback Transparency and Provenance If Jarvis needs to use an external chatbot (OpenRouter, Hugging Face, etc.), it clearly states the provider, confidence, and sources in its response. External answers are quarantined for validation before being promoted to high-confidence knowledge. 4. Unknown Flow and Learning Queue Jarvis does not simply say “I don’t know.” Instead, it: Offers to clarify the question, Asks external sources, Or queues the question for learning and returns later. All unknowns and low-confidence answers are tracked in a persistent queue (learningQueue.json) for targeted learning. 5. Memory and Knowledge Graph Jarvis stores all user interactions and AI responses in a structured memory file (vevoMemory.json). This memory is used for context in future learning cycles and to improve answer quality over time. 6. Security, Safety, and Validation Jarvis is designed to avoid storing or using PII unless explicitly consented. It can be extended to include human-in-loop review, PII redaction, and advanced validation for promoted knowledge. What Jarvis Can Do Differently Than a Chatbot Learn continuously and autonomously from both user conversations and external sources. Detect and track what it doesn’t know, and actively seek to fill those gaps. Use deterministic reasoning (math, logic, symbolic computation) before calling LLMs. Provide explicit provenance, confidence scores, and proof objects for its answers. Quarantine and validate external answers before adding them to its knowledge base. Offer options to the user when uncertain, rather than just returning a generic fallback. Maintain a persistent learning queue for unknowns, enabling targeted improvement. Log all learning, reasoning, and fallback events for transparency and auditability. Can be extended for advanced features like trading, supercomputer-like reasoning, and domain-specific intelligence. In summary: Jarvis is a meta-intelligent, self-improving AI system that combines deterministic reasoning, continuous learning, fallback transparency, and explicit provenance—making it far more capable, reliable, and auditable than a typical chatbot.",
      "response": "This text describes Jarvis, an advanced AI system that outperforms chatbots in a number of ways. Jarvis learns continuously and autonomously, identifying gaps in its knowledge and seeking to fill them. It uses deterministic reasoning for problem-solving, placing a preference on internal computation and retrieval over querying language model libraries. \n\nJarvis also exhibits full transparency, providing clear explanations of its reasoning and sourcing. When external sources are used, they are first quarantined and validated before being accepted as knowledge. Jarvis doesn't give up when it doesn't have an immediate answer, instead it clarifies, seeks external help, or queues the question for future learning. \n\nAll of this data is stored in a memory file that can provide context in later interactions and improve answer quality over time. Jarvis is designed with security in mind, built to avoid using or storing personal identifiable information (PII) unless explicitly allowed by the user. It provides options for human review, PII redaction, and advanced validation. \n\nPlus, Jarvis can be extended with advanced features like supercomputer-like reasoning, trading, and domain-specific intelligence. All information is logged for transparency and auditability. \n\nIn summary, Jarvis is more capable than a typical chatbot, offering continuous learning, clear explanation of reasoning, advance security measures, and the ability to extend features to match specific needs. It combines deterministic reasoning, continuous learning, fallback transparency, and explicit provenance. It is designed to be a reliable and auditable AI system.",

I generate responses to prompts based solely on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data. \n\nThis model has not been trained on specific documents or sources of data, and I should note that while I strive to provide accurate and timely information, I don't have the ability to access or retrieve personal data unless it has been shared with me in the course of our conversation. \n\nOn the other hand, it is possible to create a system of ongoing learning and data visualization for an AI model, but this requires a complex setup involving integration of multiple services, like data collection, storage and analysis systems, web server setup, and actual machine learning model improvement based on the collected data - all while respecting privacy rules and regulations. This is usually a task for a team of data scientists and engineers.",
